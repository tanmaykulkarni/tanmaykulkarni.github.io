<!-- Intro -->

<p>The 2016 summer internship at RnM Moving Pictures was a highly productive internship. Being a Product Development Intern I was involved in brainstorming sessions, strategical meetings and was a key member in contributing ideas and inputs which resulted
   in solving technical issues and also the launch of 'Book Your Trainer' vertical.
</p>
<p>During the 3 months of my internship I worked on -</p>

<!-- 1) HLS Streaming Protocol -->

<h2>1) HLS Streaming Protocol </h2>
<ul>I worked on video optimization and rendering via HLS and integrated Flowplayer - a minimalistic full-featured HTML5 & Flash video player. Along with Flowplayer, I also experimented with videojs and similar libraries. I developed robust video processing
    systems for rendering and playing M3U8 files that were directly served from CDN.
</ul>

<!-- 2) UI mockups and Redesigning the DWM Interface. -->

<h2>2) UI mockups and Redesigning the DWM Interface.	</h2>
<ul>My internship started off with redesigning the user interface and giving a visual overhaul to the entire Dance With Madhuri Website. I created various mockups and design prototypes of every single page and generated a user flow mechanism for a
    smooth user experience. The UI was redesigned to be cross-platform and was optimized to function on mobile and tablets. This experience allowed me to explore my creativity and design thinking in order to design user specific experiences and
    interfaces to create and deploy an exquisitely appealing product.</ul>

<!-- 3) Launched Version 2.0 Of Company's Official Website. -->

<h2>3) Launched Version 2.0 Of Company's Official Website. </h2>
<ul>What started as a general discussion turned into a side project to be completed in 2 weeks. We developed a new
    version of RnM Moving Pictures company website giving it a fashionable and a modern look. The site is developed
    using
    Twitter's Bootstrap Framework and is hosted and deployed on AWS. We were successful in meeting the 2 weeks deadline
    in order to make the site live. Check out <a href="http://www.rnmmovingpictures.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #e43e3a" ;>RnM Moving Pictures</a>.

<ul>Book Your Trainer is an off-ground service offered by Dance With Madhuri. With Book Your Trainer you can
    personalize your dance experience by booking a dance or a fitness trainer according to your convenience and needs,
    anywhere,
    anytime. My role while developing this service was to architect the service model and build front-end prototypes. My
    responsibilities also include designing and structuring the Book Your Trainer proposition and shipping the
    product to make it live on the website. Book Your Trainer was shipped during my 3 months internship period and is
    now live and integral part of Dance With Madhuri.
